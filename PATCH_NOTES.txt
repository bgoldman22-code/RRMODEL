PATCH: Moderate-power Exploitable Boost (safe add-on)

Files in this patch:
- src/MLB.jsx  (contains ONLY a new helper function with PATCH START/END markers)

What this does:
- Adds a tiny helper `moderatePowerExploitableMultiplier(candidate, pModel)`
- When a hitter sits in the 20–30% model HR% band AND the opposing pitcher relies on one pitch (>=45% usage)
  AND that pitch matches a pitch the hitter historically crushes (xwOBA-like >= .500), we apply a +3% bump.

How to integrate (two lines):
1) Paste the helper function anywhere at top-level in src/MLB.jsx (I suggest near your other multipliers).
2) In the place where you finalize the player’s `pModel` (after park/hot/cold etc, BEFORE EV is computed),
   add these lines:

   // Moderate-power exploitable micro-boost
   const mpex = moderatePowerExploitableMultiplier(candidate, pModel);
   if (mpex > 1) {
     pModel = Math.min(pModel * mpex, 0.60);   // safety cap
     why.push('mod-power exploitable +3%');    // surfaces in the UI
   }

Notes:
- The helper is defensive: if any required data (top pitch, usage, hitter-vs-pitch) is missing, it returns 1 (no change).
- It will not change your output unless conditions are clearly met.
- Zero impact on EV/anchor logic except for the tiny approved bump.
- You can tweak thresholds inside the function: usage >= 0.45, damage >= 0.50, band 0.20–0.30.
