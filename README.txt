This patch adds a minimal depth-charts.json in two places:
1) data/nfl-td/depth-charts.json      (used by serverless function fallback)
2) public/data/nfl-td/depth-charts.json (served at /data/nfl-td/depth-charts.json for quick verification)

Replace this file with your full depth charts when ready.
